SECURITY:
This using precompiled binaries for webcam capture and geolocation. These are open source projects. I encourage you to download and install them yourself rather than using the binaries provided here.
- ImageSnap command line tool (for webcam shots): http://iharder.sourceforge.net/current/macosx/imagesnap/
- Whereami project (for geolocation): https://github.com/victor/whereami
