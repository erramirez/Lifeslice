LifeSlice began as a simple script that would take my picture once an hour. It now can record a ton of stats about your time in front of the computer.

* Webcam picture of you
* Screenshot of your monitor(s)
* Word count, character count, and backspaces.
* Mouse clicks, scrolls, and distance traveled.
* Applications used and number of switches
* All of the data is viewable in a simple built-in browser. Explore some of my statistics to see. This data is stored as both a csv file and a SQLite database.
